Tests for Spruce as test management system.

For enable testing, SPRUCE_ENABLE_TESTING variable should be defined
when configure Spruce. Also, TEST_DEVICE variable should be set to
block device, which will be used as 'partition' for Spruce.

These tests are implemented as 'CTest' tests, so should be executed using
'ctest' utility.

Tests assume that Spruce is configured, built and installed.
Tests itself should be built using

    make build_tests

Some tests make unrevertable operations. Them may not executed again and
may prevent other tests execution until system is restarted.
All such tests has names with 'crash' substring.

Command

    make check

executes only normal tests, which may be executed any number of times without
system restart.
Other tests should be executed manually, using 'ctest' utility. E.g., list of such
tests may be requested using

    ctest -N -R crash
