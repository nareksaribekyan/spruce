Check, that test, corresponded to LeakChecker, has 'Failed' or
'Unresolved' status in case of unallocated frees detected by KEDR LeakChecker.

For simulate leaks, additional KEDR LeakCheck payload is used for process
bio_put() calls as frees.

It is assumed that btrfs driver uses that function when new files are created.

NB: 'Unresolved' status seems to be more appropriate for that case,
because it means that problem may be in test itself.
Unallocated frees means that KEDR LeakChecker doesn't detect corresponded
allocations, so instrument is needed to be fixed.
