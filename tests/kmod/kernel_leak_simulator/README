Kernel module which may be used for simulate possible leaks and
unallocated frees in other module.

Module is payload for KEDR LeakCheck and for KEDR platform itself. Source
code for module is generated using template for KEDR LeakCheck payloads.

When loaded with 'simulate_allocs=y', each bio_alloc() call is interpreted
by KEDR LeakChecker as memory allocation.

When loaded with 'simulate_frees=y', each bio_put() call is interpreted
by KEDR LeakChecker as memory freeing.

NB: While memory allocation interpretation in bio_alloc() seems natural,
memory freeing interpretation in bio_put() is not correct: this function
release memory only when it is last reference to 'bio' object. But fact
of 'last reference' cannot be determined using function interception
mechanism in KEDR.
